# cofiguring rack awareness
# purpose : to maintain higher availablity of the data, just in case one data node fails
-> increase HDFS availablity
-> better cluster performance


by default,HDFS and YARN are not rack awareness
-> rack awareness : knowledge of which nodes are installed on which racks
-> this awareness has to be configured manually

# how to check how many computer nodes are connected to the namenode
-> hdfs dfsadmin -report
-> hdfs fsck -racks
-> hdfs fsck -locations

# hdfs and yarn server should know about the server racks we have connected physically!
# how to inform hdfs and yarn about the physical racks


how to perform rack awareness
1. Executable python scripts
2. Mapping file
